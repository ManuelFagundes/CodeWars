def litres(time):

import math
def litres(time):
    litres = math.floor(0.5 * time)
    return  litres


# Another way of doing...The // operator divides two numbers and returns the integer part of the quotient.
#It effectively rounds the result down to the nearest whole number. Multiplying by 0.5 is equivalent to dividing by 2.
#Therefore, time // 2 directly achieves the desired result: it divides the time by 2 and rounds the result down to the nearest integer.

def litres(time):
    return time // 2
