# Another way of doing...The // operator divides two numbers and returns the integer part of the quotient.
#It effectively rounds the result down to the nearest whole number. Multiplying by 0.5 is equivalent to dividing by 2.
#Therefore, time // 2 directly achieves the desired result: it divides the time by 2 and rounds the result down to the nearest integer.

# '>>' is the right bit-shift operator. 
#Shifting a binary number one position to the right is equivalent to dividing it by 2 and discarding any remainder.
# This one I learned after seeing binary shift in the Know It All Ninja.

    return (time >> 1)
